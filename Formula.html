        <p><b>Calculas</b>,a branch of Mathematics, developed by Newton and Leibniz, 
            deals with the study of the rate of change clculas define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup> 
            <abbr title="Chief Minister"> CM</abbr> is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions. 
            <i>It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function.</i>
             Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such as <b>differentiation, 
             integration, limits, functions,</b> and so on. Scientific calculation 
             provide formilas like: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>
